    The Bell County Commissioners Court met on February 11, 2026 to discuss 
    emerging community legal services. The commissioners approved funding for 
    a new centralized legal resource center to serve residents across Bell County.
    
    The center will provide access to legal information, referral services, and 
    educational materials. It will complement existing services provided by the 
    Texas Attorney General's office and the State Bar of Texas.
    
    County Judge noted the importance of ensuring equitable access 
    to legal information for all county residents. The center is expected to open 
    by Q3 2026.
