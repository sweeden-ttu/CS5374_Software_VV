                             LangSmith Setup Instructions
Pre-requisites
Step - 0.1 [Python Setup]
Download and install Python (any version above 3.12) on your laptop/PC. Current latest version is
3.14 as of today.
https://www.python.org/downloads/
(Below YouTube videos can help with installation steps on windows & Mac)

[Windows] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mO6QXOcpqU



Step – 0.2 [Ollama Setup]
Download and install Ollama (latest version available on website) on your laptop/PC.

Step – 0.3 [miniconda]
Download and install miniconda (latest version available on website) on your laptop/PC.

(Below YouTube video can help with installation steps)

Step – 1
Extract provided project zip file (langsmith.zip) into a folder. It contains 2 sub-project folders (react-
agent, eli5) and 1 text file (requirements.txt)
Step-2
Create an Account on LangSmith website and generate an API Key

https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/create-account-api-key
Choose the configurations below while generating API Key

   •   Description – TestKey
   •   Key Type - Personal Access Token
   •   Default Workspace – Workspace1 (or whatever is available in dropdown list)
   •   Expiration Date – Never




Step-3
Update this API Key in “.env” files present inside subfolders (react-agent, eli5). You can open the file
with any text editor (like notepad) and update.
(Note: Below is a screenshot updated with API key, just for reference. Similarly, update both .env files
with your api key.)




Step-4
Open cmd (Windows) / Terminal (Mac) and execute below command. This will download and install
LLM model “llama3.2:1b” locally on your system using ollama software.
      ollama run llama3.2:1b
(Note: This command will download & install the model automatically [if it doesn’t exist already].)



Step-5
Open cmd (command prompt) in Windows (or) terminal in Mac and go to project folder location i.e.,
inside langsmith folder as shown below.




Step-6
Create conda virtual environment with python version 3.12 as shown below. This command will create
a virtual environment subfolder with name (venv) in the project folder.
      conda create -p .\venv python==3.12 -y
Step-7 (A)
After conda virtual environment is created in above step, execute below command to activate it in this
step.
       conda activate .\venv     (Windows)
       conda activate ./venv (Mac)




(Note: If command is successfully executed, you will see venv location at the left side of next line.)
Step-7 (B)
Execute the command below to install all required libraries that are present inside ‘requirements.txt’
file. Step-7(B) should be executed only after Step-7(A). This will ensure all libraries are installed inside
the conda virtual environment (venv) after it is activated.
       pip install -r requirements.txt




Step-8 (A) [ReAct-Agent Project]
Go to “react-agent” subfolder and execute below command. This will open LangSmith studio page in
your default browser as shown in the screenshot below.
       langgraph dev
(Note1: Make sure conda virtual environment (venv) is activated and you are inside folder ‘react-
agent’, before running the command)
(Note2: LangGraph ReAct Agent (Reasoning and Acting in LLMs) is a popular open-source project for
understanding internal processing in LLMs with agentic AI system.)
https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629 [Just for reference]
(Note3: Files provided as part of this project are derived from below GitHub repository and
customized to work with open-source LLMs running on ollama (like llama3.2:1b) and free web search
API (DuckDuckGo)
https://github.com/langchain-ai/react-agent [Just for reference]
You can try interacting with the agent system by giving input as ‘hi’ and submit. If everything is set up
correctly, you should see internal process of chat history on right side as shown below.
Step-8 (B)
In addition, you can observe tracing (full-length log) of this project as shown below.




Step – 9 (A) [LLM Evaluation]
Go to “eli5” subfolder and execute below command. This will open Jupyter Lab page in your default
browser as shown in the screenshot below.
       jupyter lab
(Note1: Make sure conda virtual environment (venv) is activated and you are inside folder ‘eli5’,
before running the command)
(Note2: eli5 (Explain Like I’m 5) is another popular open-source project for understanding internal
process tracing in LLMs with agentic AI system.)
https://github.com/xuro-langchain/eli5 [Just for reference]
(Note3: Files provided as part of this project are derived from above GitHub repository and
customized to work with open-source LLMs running on ollama (like llama3.2:1b) and free web search
API (DuckDuckGo)
(Note4: Below YouTube video explains about the project along with LLM Evaluation interface on
LangSmith website for reference)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEgjJyk3aTw [Just for reference]




In the browser, open file ‘eli5_complete.ipynb’ and execute cells sequentially in given order.
Explanation of each code cell is already provided just above the cell for reference.
To execute a cell, click anywhere inside the cell and click ’Run’ button at top of page. Below
screenshot for reference.




After executing all cells, you can go to LangSmith studio webpage [https://smith.langchain.com/] and
login to your account. Click on section ‘Dataset & Experiments’ on left side of page and you can see
LLM evaluation results.
Step – 9 (B)
Same code is also available in 2 files ‘eli5.py’ and ‘graph.py’ for reference.
